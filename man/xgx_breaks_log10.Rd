\title{Sets the default breaks for log10 (from R package 'xgxr')}
\usage{
xgx_breaks_log10(data_range)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_range}{range of the data}
}
\value{
numeric vector of breaks
}
\description{
\code{xgx_breaks_log10} sets nice breaks for log10 scale.
it's better than the default function because it ensures there is at least
2 breaks
and also, it will try to go by 3s (i.e. 1,3,10,30,100) if it makes sense
}
\details{
for the extended breaks function, weights is a set of 4 weights for
\enumerate{
\item simplicity - how early in the Q order are you
\item coverage - labelings that don't extend outside the data:
range(data) / range(labels)
\item density (previously granularity) - how close to the number of
ticks do you get (default is 5)
\item legibility - has to do with fontsize and formatting to prevent
label overlap
}
