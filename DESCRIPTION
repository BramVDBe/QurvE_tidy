Description: With QurvE, growth curves and fluorescence data can be
    analyzed in high throughput with three methods: linear regression,
    fitting of growth models, smooth spline fit. User-friendly wrapper
    functions allow complete data analysis workflows to be executed in a
    single step. The results of these workflows are summarized in detailed
    reports as well as in R data containers that can be intuitively
    navigated. A shiny application provides access to all features of the
    package without requiring programming knowledge.
