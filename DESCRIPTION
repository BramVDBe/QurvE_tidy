Description: With QurvE, growth curves can be analyzed in high throughput
    with three methods: linear regression on ln-transformed data, fitting
    of growth models, smooth spline fit. A user-friendly wrapper function
    allows a complete data analysis workflow to be executed in a single
    step. The results of this workflow are summarized in a detailed report
    as well as in an R data container that can be intuitively navigated.
